# Schemas-Validations

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eliasjpr/Schemas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eliasjpr/Schemas)

Schemas come to solve a simple problem. Sometimes we would like to have type-safe guarantee params when parsing HTTP parameters or Hash(String, String) for a request moreover; Schemas are to resolve precisely this problem with the added benefit of performing
business rules validation to have the params adhere to a `"business schema"`.

Schemas are beneficial, in my opinion, ideal, for when defining API Requests, Web Forms, JSON, YAML.  Schema-Validation Takes a different approach and focuses a lot on explicitness, clarity and precision of validation logic. It is designed to work with any data input, whether itâ€™s a simple hash, an array or a complex object with deeply nested data.

It is based on the idea that each validation is encapsulated by a simple, stateless predicate that receives some input and returns either true or false. Those predicates are encapsulated by rules which can be composed together using predicate logic. This means you can use the common logic operators to build up a validation schema.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  schemas:
    github: your-github-user/schemas
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "schemas"
```

```crystal
class ExampleController
  getter params : Hash(String, String)

  def initialize(@params)
  end

  schema("User") do
    param email : String
    param name : String, size: (1..20)
    param age : Int32, gte: 24, lte: 25, message: "Must be 24 and 30 years old"
    param alive : Bool, eq: true
    param childrens : Array(String)
    param childrens_ages : Array(Int32)

    schema("Address") do
      param street : String, size: (5..15)
      param zip : String, match: /\d{5}/
      param city : String, size: 2, in: %w[NY NJ CA UT]
    end
  end

  validation do
    , match: /\w+@\w+\.\w{2,3}/, message: "Email must be valid!"
  end
end

params = HTTP::Params.parse(
  "email=test@example.com&name=john&age=24&alive=true&" +
  "childrens=Child1,Child2&childrens_ages=1,2&" +
  // Nested Params
  "address.city=NY&address.street=Sleepy Hollow&address.zip=12345"
)

subject = ExampleController.new(params.to_h)
```

Schemas are defined as value objects, meaning structs, which are NOT mutable,
making them ideal to pass schema object as arguments to constructors.

```crystal
user = subject.user
address = user.address

user.valid?.should be_true
address.valid?.should be_true
```

### Casting to Custom Types

This is WIP

```crystal
class CustomType
  include Schema::CastAs(CustomType)

  def initialize(@value : String)
  end

  def value
    convert(self.class)
  end

  // Provide a convert method to handle the casting
  def convert(asType : self.class)
    @value.split(",").map { |i| i.to_i32 }
  end
end
```

### Custom Validations

This is WIP.

Create a module that extends from schema Validations module.

```crystal
require "some_model"

module Validations
  module Custom
    def unique?(value, enabled : Bool = true)
      SomeModel.where(name: value).count.zero? if enabled
    end
  end
end

schema("User") do
  param name : String, unique: true
end
```

Notice that `unique:` corresponds to `unique?`.
This is how the library know which validation to perform.
